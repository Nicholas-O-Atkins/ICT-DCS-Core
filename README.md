 Making a Ticketing System for the game Warframe so me and my friends can keep track of things we are planning on farming or are currently farming, we usually sent over txt files of parts that we needed and as more people got involved in it we had some issues keeping track of what we could sell to the ducat gods so now I am planning and making this to see if I can. Still debating whether to create a DB seed or just populate it myself by hand first and create an export as a seed after. Leaning towards the second option since Warframes crafting system has so many different things. I am following a tutorial on MVC coding on youtube but, deviating from the pokemon options used in their tutorial, figured that doing my own thing while keeping the bones would make it stay in my head better.
